'''
The road transport corporation(RTC) of a city wants to know whether a particular bus-route
is running on profit or loss.

Assume that the following information are given:
Price per litre of fuel = 70
Mileage of the bus in km/litre of fuel = 10
Price(Rs) per ticket = 80

The bus runs on multiple routes having different distance in kms and number of passengers.
Write a function to calculate and return the profit earned(Rs) in each route. Return - 1 
in case of loss.

Also write the pytest test cases to test the program.

'''


def calculate(distance, no_of_passengers):
    pass


distance = 20
no_of_passengers = 50
print(calculate(distance, no_of_passengers))
